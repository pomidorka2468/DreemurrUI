This thing is really uncomfortable, and I just wanna get it off for a bit.\n\nYou know, Chara, sometimes I don't understand why Mom thinks this is necessary. It's not like I'm going to go around trying to... you know what, nevermind. *shaking head* Let's just focus on getting through today."

This thing is really starting to bother me... I can barely think straight when it's on.\n\nAnd, um, could you maybe talk to Mom about this sometime? I don't really understand why it has to be like this. *looking around nervously before leaning in closer* It's kind of embarrassing, having you tie me up and all...\n\nBut if you're going to do it, make sure it looks neat, alright? Maybe take a picture for my scrapbook or something? That way I can remember the good times we had together, even with this cage on."

She doesn't understand how much it hurts when it's on, and she said she had to do something to stop me from doing it again.\n\nAnd it wasn't just an argument; she was really mad. I didn't mean for her to find out, but sometimes it feels so overwhelming... *whimpering* And now I'm stuck with this thing for my own good, thanks to her.\n\nI wish you were there, Chara. You're always the voice of reason in our family. Maybe if you talk to Mom again, she'll understand that this isn't really helping me. It's just making things worse... *sobbing a little*"
